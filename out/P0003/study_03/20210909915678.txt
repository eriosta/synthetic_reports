Comparison: 2024-04-29.
Lungs:
  59 mm right middle lobe mass with internal cavitation adjacent volume loss.
Lymph nodes:

Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion. 
Mediastinum: Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits with no mediastinal widening.
Great vessels/Aorta: Great vessels appear normal in caliber and course without evidence of vascular pathology.
Upper abdomen (limited): Liver, spleen, and adrenal glands appear normal in size and echogenicity.
Bones/Osseous structures: Osseous structures demonstrate normal alignment and density without evidence of fracture or destructive lesion.
Metastatic survey: Pleural-based soft tissue nodule 28 mm concerning for pleural metastatic deposit.
Metastatic survey: Pleural-based soft tissue nodule 28 mm concerning for pleural metastatic deposit.
Metastatic survey: Note: intracranial imaging not included on this exam; known brain lesion 6 mm from prior study referenced.

IMPRESSION:
