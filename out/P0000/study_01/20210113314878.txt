FINDINGS:
Beam hardening artifact from contrast material in great vessels mildly limits evaluation.
Lungs:
  55 mm right lower lobe mass with irregular, spiculated contour spiculated margins.
Lymph nodes:
  Enlarged 4L lymph node measuring 17 mm in short-axis.
  Subcentimeter 4R node measuring 10 mm short-axis.
  Subcentimeter 2L node measuring 12 mm short-axis.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion. 
Mediastinum: Mediastinum demonstrates normal contours without evidence of mass or lymphadenopathy.
Great vessels/Aorta: Thoracic aorta demonstrates normal caliber without evidence of aneurysm, dissection, or other abnormality.
Upper abdomen (limited): Upper abdominal structures demonstrate normal appearance without focal abnormality.
Bones/Osseous structures: Bones appear normal without evidence of metastatic disease or other osseous pathology.
Metastatic survey: No definite distant metastases identified.

IMPRESSION:
- Primary lung neoplasm in the right lower lobe measuring approximately 55 mm.
- Nodal disease as detailed above.
- No definite distant metastases identified.
