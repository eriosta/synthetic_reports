FINDINGS:
Beam hardening artifact from contrast material in great vessels mildly limits evaluation.
Lungs:
  30 mm left lower lobe mass with spiculated margins adjacent volume loss.
Lymph nodes:
  No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion. 
Mediastinum: Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits with no mediastinal widening.
Great vessels/Aorta: Great vessels appear normal in caliber and course without evidence of vascular pathology.
Upper abdomen (limited): Liver, spleen, and adrenal glands appear normal in size and echogenicity.
Bones/Osseous structures: Osseous structures demonstrate normal alignment and density without evidence of fracture or destructive lesion.
Metastatic survey: No definite distant metastases identified.

IMPRESSION:
- Primary lung neoplasm in the left lower lobe measuring approximately 30 mm.
- No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes by size criteria.
- No definite distant metastases identified.
