FINDINGS:
Comparison: 2024-05-07.
Lungs:
  12 mm right lower lobe mass with irregular, spiculated contour internal cavitation.
Lymph nodes:
  Enlarged 7 lymph node measuring 8 mm in short-axis.
  Subcentimeter 10R node measuring 15 mm short-axis.
Pleura/Pleural spaces: No pleural effusion. 
Mediastinum: Mediastinum demonstrates normal contours without evidence of mass or lymphadenopathy.
Great vessels/Aorta: Thoracic aorta demonstrates normal caliber without evidence of aneurysm, dissection, or other abnormality.
Upper abdomen (limited): Liver, spleen, and adrenal glands appear normal in size and echogenicity.
Bones/Osseous structures: Bones appear normal without evidence of metastatic disease or other osseous pathology.
Metastatic survey: Sclerotic osseous focus 10 mm in a vertebral body, concerning for metastasis.

IMPRESSION:
- Primary lung neoplasm in the right lower lobe measuring approximately 12 mm.
- Nodal disease as detailed above.
- Findings suspicious for distant metastatic disease as above.
